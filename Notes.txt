OOP's concept is used in very larg and complex programs.

OOP's concept is based on 4 Principles :-
    
    Encapsulation
        -The main goal of Encapsulation is to restrict dirct access to some of an object's information compononents direclt and to make a controlled way to access/to interact with them.
        -Eg:Banking System
    Abstraction

    Inheritence
        -The main goal Inhritence is to allow a Child class to reuse some of the data, behaviors or properties from a Parent class.
        -Eg: Hierarchy: Vehicles -> Cars , Trains, Planes.
    
    Polymorphism
        -   The main goal of Polymorphism is to let the same action behave differently based on the object that is performing the action.
        -Eg:Imagine you tell different animals to "speak."
                A dog will "bark."
                A cat will "meow."
                A cow will "moo."
